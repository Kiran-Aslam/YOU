# YOU 🌟  
**A 15-Day Self-Discovery Journal Built with Streamlit**

Welcome to **YOU** — a calm digital space designed to help you slow down, reflect, and reconnect with the person you truly are beneath all the noise.

## 🧠 About the Project
**YOU** is not just a journaling app. It’s a mirror — one that encourages self-awareness through daily guided prompts, stillness practices, and gentle self-exploration.

Inspired by the book *“The Art of Being Alone”*, this 15-day journey offers:
- ✨ Daily themed tasks  
- 🧘 Mindfulness exercises with timers  
- ✍️ Reflective writing prompts  
- 🎧 Soothing audio atmosphere  
- 💻 Built using **Streamlit**

## 💡 Why I Created This
We often spend so much time becoming what others want us to be, that we forget to ask:
> "Who am I, really?"

This project is a quiet space — for anyone tired of pretending, seeking clarity, or simply wanting to reconnect with their real self.

> 💬 *"You don’t need fixing. You need listening."*
